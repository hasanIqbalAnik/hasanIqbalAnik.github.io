I am an assistant professor of EECS at the <a href="https://www.uwyo.edu/">University of Wyoming</a>. I got my PhD under the supervision of the incomparable Dr. Walter O. Krawec, from the <a href="http://www.uconn.edu">University of Connecticut</a>. My primary research interest is in quantum information theory.Â  More specifically, I am interested in improving the performance of quantum communication and cryptographic protocols using high-dimensional quantum states. Furthermore, I am interested in the study of quantum non-local phenomena, such as the entanglement and discord in different quantum channels and among states with higher dimensions, which have potential applications in building quantum networks. My CV can be found <a href="files/cv_expanded.pdf">here</a>.
